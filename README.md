[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/built-with-science.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

Here lies the documentation for the Natural History Museum's Data Portal API. It can be viewed [here](https://naturalhistorymuseum.github.io/dataportal-api-docs).

The Data Portal uses [CKAN](https://github.com/ckan/ckan) and as such their [API docs](http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/api/index.html) may also be of help.

The docs are generated with the help of [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate).
