This repository contains documentation/links to documentation for the [Natural History Museum's Data Portal](https://data.nhm.ac.uk/).

## Data Portal API

The Natural History Museum's Data Portal API documentation can be viewed [here](https://naturalhistorymuseum.github.io/dataportal-docs).

The Data Portal uses [CKAN](https://github.com/ckan/ckan) and as such their [API docs](http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/api/index.html) may also be of help.

The docs are generated with the help of [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate) through this repository.


## Data Portal Development Roadmap

The epics that are part of the Data Portal's development current roadmap can be found [in this project](https://github.com/NaturalHistoryMuseum/dataportal-docs/projects/1) or [under this milestone](https://github.com/NaturalHistoryMuseum/dataportal-docs/milestone/1).
