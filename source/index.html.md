# Introduction

Welcome to the Data Portal API docs!

The Natural History Museum in London, UK shares a wealth of its research data via the [Data Portal](http://data.nhm.ac.uk) website. The API provides a RESTful interface to this information.

Please feel free to [contact us](http://data.nhm.ac.uk/contact) if you have any questions!

# Basics

## Access

> We do not currently have any packages providing an easy syntax for accessing the API; access is just via URLs.

```python
import requests

base_url = 'http://data.nhm.ac.uk/api/3'
```

The base URL for the API is `http://data.nhm.ac.uk/api/3`.

Use of the Data Portal API does not currently require a key or any kind of authentication.

<aside class="notice">
Please use common sense when using the API, and cache results wherever possible. We reserve the right to suspend API access if you continuously make multiple calls per second.
</aside>

## Results

> A basic successful result looks like this:

```json
{
  "help": "A description of the action.",
  "success": true,
  "result": ["item1", "item2"]
}
```

> An unsuccessful result looks like this:

```json
{
  "help": "A description of the action.",
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "message": "This is what you did wrong.",
    "__type": "ErrorType"
  }
}
```

Results are returned in JSON format, with two basic keys: `help` (which describes the action called) and `success` (a boolean indicating whether the request was successful or not).

If the request was successful, the items will be returned under the `result` key.

If the action was valid but the parameters were not, you will get `success: false` and an error message.

# Datasets

## List datasets

```python
requests.get(base_url)
```

```shell
curl "http://example.com/api/kittens"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Fluffums",
    "breed": "calico",
    "fluffiness": 6,
    "cuteness": 7
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Max",
    "breed": "unknown",
    "fluffiness": 5,
    "cuteness": 10
  }
]
```

Datasets are sometimes also referred to as _packages_.
